# tetris
My project with javascript.
I was inspired by example from the internet. 
I wanted to try my hand at JavaScript.
<img src="first.png" alt"home-page">
I used <canvas> element. I drew text on the Canvas to start game.
<img src="second.png" alt="game">
 I used second <canvas> to show next tetromino. I hide borders to look more aesthetically. 
<img src="third.png" alt="game">
